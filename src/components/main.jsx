        <p className='mt-4'>Chef Norihiro Ishizuka’s culinary journey began at the age of thirteen working at Kappo and udon restaurants to support his mother and four other siblings. With over sixty years of culinary experience and several accomplished restaurants under his belt, he brings to fruition his udon noodle concept: Raku. <br /> <br />

        In an homage to his home cooking, Ishizuka crafts a menu centered around this iconic noodle long served as a classic comfort food in Japan. Voluminous bowls of chewy silky noodles are served in Ishizuka’s signature dashi soup. In addition to an extensive udon offering, Ishizuka also showcases an appetizer menu offering some of Japan’s most classic small bites. Offering a contemporary and minimalist dining space paired with warm service, he seeks to create happy memories for customers through his food.</p>
